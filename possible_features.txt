Features and ideas:

- Send notification about updates, and whether there was some significant change.
- 	If there was a change for user X, offer him to see the new value and watch an
	ad if this is the second time he's tried this day.
		If ads are implemented, could also add a "advertiser" account and let them advertise for users that liked specific courses.
- Languages: Support for English, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic?
- Written user reviews and was review helpful or not. Show only reviews that were helpful.
- Questions about a given review? (Click on review, forwarded to page where the review is on at the top of the page and below is Q&A)
- Do not allow users to add too many reviews at once? Maybe 10 a day at max? Maybe have to enter some captcha or use a Google captcha service?
- When giving a user a recommendation about some course, also show information regarding whether the course has video, average, what type of homework, more? Show info only if it is updated. (Dennis)
- Automatic scraping of data from UG for data on courses.
- Additionally, show courses based on what you're planning to take in the next semester.
- Guest account for seeing course data without any recommendation.
- Search a course and ask if it is recommended for me  or not.
- Filter courses by different characteristics (has homework, has exam, needs partners)
- Allow user to send data about a course with unknown info (ie course has takef HW or has an exam), maybe allow each user to change this anyways.
	Add moderator for managing these requests???
- (UI) Filter courses based on Must, choice, free choice...
- Show recommended courses based only what's being done next semester.
- IF really going for Computer Science, show a map of the Technion and where each course is taking place. (PROBABLY NOT, a bit forced)
- Mark courses as "possibly taking"
- For courses that need partners, allow to search for partners using some sort of list of others that are "possibly taking". (Maybe by checking through Facebook if two people who are "possibly taking" are also friends on Facebook)
	- Partners: Allow sending a message of type "I want to be your partner", default send sender's email, if signed in by Facebook/Google then by Messenger/Google+ (or whatever)
	- I am looking for a partner in a course I'm interested in taking.
- Know which catalogue a use is taking so we can show courses relevant to his catalogue (Maybe hard?)
- Some interesting UI for liking/disliking courses? Checkbox? Drag and drop the course names? Tinder-like? We want a UI that won't waste the user's time and maybe will be like a fun game.
- Notifications for updates in recommendations, partners.
	- Partners: I want to get a notification when a friend of mine is looking for a partner (or maybe just interested?) in a course I might be taking.
- At first we'll show the popular courses as recommendations, then later we'll integrate the recommendation engine in and fully use it.




- Recommendation engine through collaborative filtering
- Possible that the algorithm will take long to implement
-- Use some "regular algorithm on the way"
- Not enough reviews in time
