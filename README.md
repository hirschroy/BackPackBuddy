# Course Freak
CourseFreak is an Android app for students. It is in fact a unified platform for many course-related tasks that can easily be done through the app's interactive environment.

The app offers its users **personalized content** according to their preferences by producing **recommendations** for them, based on their liking. Our ML engine is a simple [Collaborative Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) we implmented in java, and you can find [here](https://github.com/Technion236503/2019a-CourseFreak/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/coursefreak/app/utils/Recommender.java) the code . Users can read and write **reviews**, Look for a partner and **get notifications** when new options arise.

The app was built with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) (Java) and uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for user authentication, database and [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/). The course data we used was downloaded and reformatted from Technion CS faculty's website and was formatted to [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) with the corresponding fields. Feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or suggestions.
