CourseFreak is a student-targeted app for course recommendations, partner finding, and reviewing courses. 

The app consists of an automatic recommendation engine for helping the students pick out their courses, as well as a student-driven review system for letting students express their own thoughts on different courses, and assisting in partner finding when two friends might be taking a course that requires partners.
