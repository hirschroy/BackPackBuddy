The app offers its users **personalized content** according to their preferences, and allows them to filter the courses-related content they are exposed to. The users can read and write **reviews**, request and respond to **teaming-up suggestions**, give **feedback** to other reviews and contribute to their school society by helping us **improve data accuracy and freshness**. The app is simple and easy to use and supports multiple languages. It is based on [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) (Java) and uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for most of our core services.
