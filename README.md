# 2019a-CourseFreak

CourseFreak is a student-targeted app for course recommendations, partner finding, and reviewing. The app consists of an automatic recommendation engine for helping the students pick out their courses, as well as a student-driven review system for letting students express their own thoughts on different courses, and assisting in partner finding when two friends might be taking a course that requires partners.
The app will also offer limited guest capabilities that grant general statistics on data inputs by registered users.
